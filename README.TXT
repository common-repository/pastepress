This plugin will allow to embed a pastebin form into your website.

== Description ==

The plugin will allow users to embed a pastebin form into a wordpress page or post, using a special syntax. The form allows to paste plain text and save it getting back a direct link to it. This is how usually pastebin works: you will have it working inside your blog.

The plugin is built against PasteBox 1.0.

**WARNING**
The plugin may not work until first beta release.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How doeas it work? =

Simply create a new page, put inside the textbox the special tag (<!-PASTEPRESS->) and save. Open the page, write down a title and paste your text inside the textbox. Once you press the 'post' button, your text will be stored as text file: save the link to share the content on forums and with mates.

= Can I put anything else into that page? =

Sure. You can insert eveything just above or below the special tag (e.g. explaination text, footnote or disclaimer).

= Can I paste formatted text? =

No. PastePress is meant to dump plain text (as most of pastebin scripts).

= Does it support syntax highlighted text? =

We plan to introduce syntax highlight support through <a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/" title="Geshi Homepage">geshi</a> library in future stable release.
